# CFG Javascript and React

## Branches of Time

This project is been created during the CFG course for JavaScript and React.

The project simulates a genealogy website where the user can create its own tree.

## Work phases

The features available to the user will be added gradually. Initially there will be no login available, only allowing for a single user use.

While no database is set up localStorage will be used.

The user will be able to edit the information saved.

A burger menu or an easiest way to navigate from one page to the other will be set up.
